e.g lets suppose at 10 am i worked for 50 min, them i'll enter 50, then at 1pm i worked again for 40 min
so ill keep on add 40 to the habbit tracker.py. It will automatically keep on adding to my time and it will also show the 
total time for which I've worked today.

NOTE: habbit tracker.py loads up data from the data.json(in congfig) so please dont delete that file.
